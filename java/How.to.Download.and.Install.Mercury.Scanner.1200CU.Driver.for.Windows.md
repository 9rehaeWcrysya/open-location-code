However, finding the right driver for your Mercury Scanner 1200CU can be challenging, especially if you have a newer version of Windows, such as Windows 10 or Windows 7. The manufacturer of the scanner, Kobian Pte Ltd., does not provide official drivers for these versions of Windows on their website. They only offer drivers for older versions of Windows, such as Windows XP or Windows 98.
 
So, how can you download and install the Mercury Scanner 1200CU driver for Windows? There are two possible ways: using an automatic driver update utility or manually finding and installing the driver from a third-party source. Here are the steps for each method:
 
## Method 1: Using an Automatic Driver Update Utility
 
An automatic driver update utility is a software that scans your computer for outdated or missing drivers and downloads and installs the latest ones for you. This can save you time and hassle of searching for drivers online and installing them manually. There are many driver update utilities available online, but some of them may not be reliable or safe. Therefore, you should use a trusted and reputable one, such as DriverGuide.com.
 
DriverGuide.com is a website that offers a large database of drivers for various devices and manufacturers, including Mercury Scanner. It also has a scanner driver update utility that can automatically detect your scanner model and operating system and find the most compatible driver for it. To use this utility, follow these steps:
 
1. Go to [https://www.driverguide.com/driver/company/Mercury/Scanner/index.html](https://www.driverguide.com/driver/company/Mercury/Scanner/index.html) and click on the "Mercury Scanner Automatic Driver Update Utility" link.
2. Download and run the utility on your computer.
3. Follow the instructions on the screen to scan your computer for scanner drivers.
4. If the utility finds a suitable driver for your Mercury Scanner 1200CU, click on the "Install" button to download and install it.
5. Restart your computer and test your scanner to see if it works.

## Method 2: Manually Finding and Installing the Driver from a Third-Party Source
 
If you prefer to find and install the driver for your Mercury Scanner 1200CU manually, you will need to search for it online from a third-party source. However, this method is not recommended, as it may involve some risks. For example, you may download a wrong or incompatible driver that may cause your scanner or computer to malfunction. You may also download a malicious or infected file that may harm your computer or compromise your security. Therefore, you should be careful and cautious when downloading drivers from unknown sources.
 
One possible source of drivers for your Mercury Scanner 1200CU is Computing.net, a website that offers answers and solutions for various computing problems. On this website, there is a question posted by a user who asked for a mercury scanner 1200cu+ driver download windows 7. The answer provided by another user is that there is no Windows 7 driver for the Mercury 1200 scanner series, and that the user will have to buy a new scanner to use on Windows 7. However, there is also a link to download a driver file named "Mercury\_1200CU\_Plus.zip" from MediaFire.com, which is an online file sharing service.
 
This file may or may not work for your Mercury Scanner 1200CU on Windows 7 or Windows 10. It may also contain viruses or malware that may damage your computer. Therefore, you should only download it at your own risk and discretion. To download and install this file, follow these steps:
