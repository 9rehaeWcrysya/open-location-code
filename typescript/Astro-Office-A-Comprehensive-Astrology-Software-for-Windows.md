Vedic astrology is one of the oldest and most revered forms of astrology in the world. It originates from the ancient Vedas, the sacred texts of Hinduism, and is also known as Jyotisha, which means "the science of light". Vedic astrology is based on the belief that the movements and positions of the planets and stars influence human life and destiny.
 
Vedic astrology uses a different system of zodiac signs than Western astrology. While Western astrology is based on the tropical zodiac, which is aligned with the seasons, Vedic astrology is based on the sidereal zodiac, which is aligned with the fixed stars. This means that there is a difference of about 23 degrees between the two zodiacs, and therefore your sun sign in Vedic astrology may be different from your sun sign in Western astrology.
 
Vedic astrology also has a unique way of dividing the zodiac into 27 lunar mansions, called nakshatras. Each nakshatra has a specific meaning and influence on your personality, talents, challenges and destiny. Vedic astrology also uses a system of planetary periods, called dashas, which indicate the major themes and events in your life according to the ruling planet at any given time.
 
Vedic astrology can help you to understand your true nature, your strengths and weaknesses, your karmic lessons and your soul's purpose. It can also guide you to make wise choices and decisions in various areas of life, such as career, relationships, health and spirituality. Vedic astrology is a profound and holistic way of exploring yourself and your connection to the cosmos.
