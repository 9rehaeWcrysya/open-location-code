The movie begins with Lara Croft diving into an underwater temple off the coast of Greece, where she discovers a mysterious sphere that contains a map to the location of Pandora's Box, a powerful artifact that can unleash a deadly plague upon the world. However, before she can retrieve it, she is ambushed by a group of mercenaries working for Jonathan Reiss (CiarÃ¡n Hinds), a Nobel Prize-winning scientist who plans to use the box as a weapon of mass destruction.
 
Lara escapes with the sphere and contacts MI6, who inform her that Reiss is a former bio-weapons dealer who has gone rogue. They also tell her that the only person who knows Reiss's whereabouts is Terry Sheridan (Gerard Butler), a former British Special Air Service officer who was Lara's lover and partner until he betrayed her and was imprisoned in Kazakhstan.
